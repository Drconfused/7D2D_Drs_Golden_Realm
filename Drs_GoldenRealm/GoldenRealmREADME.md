<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~TO DO/WISH LIST~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->

	1. test out the spawnTrader block and figure out if it is something that I want to add in the game as a quest reward. If it works as intended it could be given as a reward so you can place a trader where ever wanted.
	
	2. Considering making something that allows the player to obtain a kit that rewards a certain amount of experience and or skill points in case an update makes a character reset. Usually all items are still kept but land claims could be deactivated. It would have numerous options;
		Reclaim Box 1: 
			10 skill points, bedroll, landclaim
		Reclaim Box 2:
			20 skill points, bedroll, landclaim
		Reclaim Box 3:
			100,000 exp, bedroll, landclaim

		Quest updates
			- !!!CAUTION!!! before updating make sure you abandon all the Second Bases quests in the quest log as it will reset your character if they are in there because I changed the zombie kill portion to generic kills rather than specific kills otherwise the quest can become stuck and unable to complete if zombies die from traps or other means that don't credit the kills.
			- discovered that for the quests which are auto completed nothing other than the rewards need to be filled out and they are automatically given. Reducing the given rewards of the Base Constructor series to this method and adding rewards to the main quest that are selected. After numerous play throughs I found I would like to be able to have at least some options that I could select from.
	0.04
		Blocks update:
			- terrStone now has a small chance to drop silver, gold, or diamond nuggets.
			- all the lights throughout the world can be picked up by destroying the object and than placed as a player owned light, but requires power to turn on just like any other player owned light.
			- all the collapsed workstations and power banks can be destroyed to pick up and then repaired at a workbench to make into the working variation.
		Items update:
			- Loot box adjustments;
				- reduced amount of loot in some boxes for balance.
				- More loot boxes added; 
					- Blood Crate, First Aid Kit
					- Further defining the Grades of Loot boxes into 3 tiers:
						- LootBox_?_GradeA
						- LootBox_?_GradeB
						- LootBox_?_GradeC
						 *?= defines the type.
				- Icon additions;
					- Combat loot box
					- Construction loot box
		Loot Tables:
			- questMedicKit
			- questMedicDrugs
			- questMedicHollistic
			- added (loot_quality_template="questTierFlexibleTemplate") to the questKillerGuns and questKillerMelee and removed the count="1" in the lootgroup name as it was only rewarding quality tier 1 weapons, hopefully this will result in better quality items being received.
			- added Drs_BloodCase & Drs_FirstAid_Kit to the medicine, rareMedicine, & airdropMedicine lootgroups.
			- added a whole series of loot tables to the BaseConstructor portion
			- added in autoTurret loot and added it to the Base Constructor Main Loot in questBaseDefense

	0.03 a (only released on github)
		Quest Updates
			Made the Second Base series to reward the loot box system.

			Coking Coal is now crafted at the chemstation
		
	0.02
		Quest Reward Changes

			- The loot boxes are based on the quest system so at this time they say <read> in order to activate them.

<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~MADNESS NOTES~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->			

	1. I want to continue the building format of the basic survival quests. What is the basis and where do the outcomes point towards?
		Basis is to reward following the upgrade path of basebuilding and to make it feel like it adds an rpg element to the basis of base building.
		The rpg element is the potential discourse and narrative between the player and the Trader. 
		The Trader is in need of community, without individuals to trade with a trader is useless. 
	
	2. 
		// After cashing in the initial start quest start the Base Constructor quest.
			Can give it as a note rather then force start or we can see how to make a popup like the initial start quest.
			
				Trader wants
				
				
		//Greetings Survivor, if you have come across this note, be aware that we have set up a system of trades across the habitable land for those that would work hard and bring materials for already made building materials. 
		2.1 We want to start you out small, bring to a trader 
			20 clay 
			or
			20 stone and we will give you 10 flagstone blocks
			
	3. Base Constructor series
		Make it so that this is the quest series right after finding the trader. It should come across like the trader is helping his community grow. It should be a significant reward as far as Dukes go, make it clear that the trader is doing this for insentive to have a good trade partner.
			3.1 Trading basic materials for the recipe equivalent to make them through quests cashed in at the trader.
			3.2 Should they be craftable notes? Or should they be found? How should the quest system work?
				3.2.1 For starters making it a hand it to the trader so it can be assessed how well that works. Adds a little more to the idea of a functional trading system.
